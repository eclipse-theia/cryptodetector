# Crypto-Detector

## Description

The **crypto-detector** extension is a language-server and client extension which uses static analysis of source code in order to detect use of **cryptography**.

The tool uses [Wind-River/crypto-detector]( https://github.com/Wind-River/crypto-detector) in order to scan source code and determine if cryptography exists using the following [two methods](https://github.com/Wind-River/crypto-detector#methods-of-scanning-code):

1. _keyword_: simple scan for any use of terms, words related to cryptography.
2. _API finder_: deeper scan for use of API calls and libraries related to cryptography.

The extension is tested and works successfully in both `Eclipse Theia` based products and `VS Code`.

## Components

1. **crypto-detector** language-server
2. **crypto-detector** language-client
